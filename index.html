        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          My work spans the development of scalable ML architectures for content verification, security, and analytics. I've built and deployed systems that process 18+ TB of audio data from 400+ streams, developed novel deepfake detection frameworks with 88% accuracy (featured in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/real-time-video-deepfake-scams-reality-defender/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition-colors" target="_blank">WIRED</a>), and engineered Bayesian frameworks for uncertainty quantification in ML models. My expertise includes transformer architectures, distributed ML systems, computer vision, speech processing, and ML optimization for production environments.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          I've published at top ML and security venues including NeurIPS, ICLR, and IEEE Security conferences, with my work on deepfake detection receiving $100,000 in industry funding. My approach combines rigorous ML engineering with practical solutions for real-world problems, bridging the gap between academic research and industry applications.
