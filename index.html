    My research focuses on mathematical modeling and algorithmic optimization, with applications in uncertainty quantification, statistical verification, and decision support systems. I develop robust frameworks that combine rigorous theoretical foundations with practical implementations, publishing at premier venues including NeurIPS, ICLR, and IEEE Security.

    I'm passionate about creating systems that leverage mathematical principles to solve complex problems across domains. I'm interested in applied ML positions and quantitative research where I can solve practical problems at scale. Please explore my <a href="/publications" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition-colors">publications</a> and <a href="/projects" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition-colors">projects</a> to see examples of my work.
