          My research focuses on critical intersections of AI and security, encompassing
          innovative approaches to deepfake detection in audio and video,
          mining radio livestreams, memory forensics,
          and biometric systems. I specialize in developing human-centric,
          usable systems that address real-world challenges. Through my doctoral
          research, I have contributed several novel systems and datasets that
          advance the field and support the broader research community.
