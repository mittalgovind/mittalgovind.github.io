          My research spans multiple areas of AI and security, including deepfake detection in audio and video,
          uncertainty quantification, machine unlearning, memory forensics,
          and biometrics. I am passionate for creating and engineering  human-centric
          and usable systems. Throughout my Ph.D.,
          I've contributed several novel systems and datasets to the research
          community.
