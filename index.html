          My work focuses on building high-performance ML architectures for content verification, media security, and real-time analytics. I've engineered fault-tolerant ML pipelines processing 18+ TB of streaming data with 99.8% uptime, developed award-winning diffusion models for identity-preserving image generation (Best Paper Award at IJCB 2023), and created novel deepfake detection frameworks with 88% accuracy (featured in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/real-time-video-deepfake-scams-reality-defender/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition-colors" target="_blank">WIRED</a>). My technical expertise spans transformer architectures, diffusion models, distributed ML systems, MLOps, computer vision, speech processing, and optimization techniques for production environments.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          I've published at top ML and security venues including NeurIPS, ICLR, IEEE Security, and AsiaCCS, with my research on multimodal deepfake detection attracting $100,000 in industry funding. My approach combines rigorous ML engineering with practical solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production-ready applications. I've led teams of 6+ engineers through the complete ML lifecycle, implemented CI/CD for ML systems, and reduced model training time by 70% while improving accuracy through advanced optimization techniques.
