I am a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">New York University's Tandon School of Engineering</a>,
advised by <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/nasir-memon">Prof. Nasir Memon</a> and <a href="https://chinmayhegde.github.io/pubs/">Prof. Chinmay Hegde</a>.
Previously, I graduated in 2019, with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan, India.

Through my Ph.D. journey, I have touched several research topics, such as Deepfake Detection -- audio and video --, Uncertainty Quantification,
Machine Unlearning, Memory Forensics and Biometrics. I have curated and released several datasets across text, speech and vision modalities.
My current research interests revolve around making tech ethical and usable for us, humans.
