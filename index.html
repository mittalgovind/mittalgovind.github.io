I am a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">New York University Tandon School of Engineering</a>,
advised by Prof. Nasir Memon and Prof. Chinmay Hegde.

Thanks for checking out my academic profile. I also have a life outside of academics, if you are interested.
