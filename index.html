          My research focuses on intersections of AI and security, encompassing
          innovative approaches to deepfake detection in audio and video,
          mining radio livestreams, memory forensics,
          and biometric systems. Through my doctoral
          research, I have contributed several novel systems and datasets across text, speech and vision modalities, that
          advance the field and support the broader research community.
